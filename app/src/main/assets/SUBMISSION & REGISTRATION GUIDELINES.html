					<p><u><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Poster Presentation Guidelines:</strong></span></u><br>
						We are happy to share with you that for the virtual version of the STI 2021, we have planned an exciting innovative arrangement of poster presentations.</p>
					<p>There will be a 2-hour poster session on the second day (19 Dec) where all the presenters will have their 5 mins video presentations, recorded before and displayed on a web portal. Each video record will have a link to the poster and link to the virtual room number where the presenter would be available. An audience can check out the video, the poster, and can meet the presenter in the specific virtual room for detailed conversations. All the participants hence are required to be present in the room from 30 mins prior to the very end of the session. A panel of 20+ expert members will also roam around the virtual rooms for sharing their comments and suggestions in addition to evaluating the merit of the works. All the details of the session will be communicated to the presenters in time.</p>
					<p>Your presentation video (5 min) and a single page poster should cover the KEY POINTS of your work. The ideal video and poster are designed to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Attract attention of the audience</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Provide a brief overview of your work</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Initiate discussion and questions</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Communicate the key contributions in brief</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Once registration of your poster paper is completed, please upload your poster and video(5 min) link through <a href="https://fse.green.edu.bd/sti-2021/poster-paper-submission">http://fse.green.edu.bd/sti-2021/poster-paper-submission</a> by 10 November 2021</p>
					<p>The title of your poster should appear at the top in CAPITAL letters about 25mm (1″) high. Use color to highlight and make your poster more attractive including pictures, diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc., wherever possible rather than only texts. The author(s) name(s) and affiliation(s) are to be put below the title.</p>
					<p>There will be three "Best Poster Paper" awards for authors presenting their works. The posters will be reviewed by a panel of judges who will not only take into account the quality of the display but also the content of the work by asking a series of questions to the author(s). It is, therefore, necessary to be as ready for your poster presentation in your designated virtual room as you would be for an oral presentation.</p>
					<p>Please note that your presented paper will be included in the STI conference proceedings but won't be published in the IEEE Xplore digital library.</p>
					<p>All the registered poster paper presenters are entitled to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Have their papers published in the STI 2021 Proceedings</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Get constructive suggestions and feedback from the experts in the field</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Compete for the Best poster paper award (prize money + certificates)</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Receive an attractive set of Conference Kits</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Access to all the keynotes, technical sessions, tutorial and workshops</strong></li>
					</ul>
