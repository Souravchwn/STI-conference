				<h2> About The Event</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The Industry 4.0 refers to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that encompasses smart industries, smart grids, intelligent transportation, real-time healthcare, etc. bolstered by automation and cyber-physical systems. Detail studies and researches are required to design and develop sustainable technologies for Industry 4.0 since they depend on complex relations among humans, systems and objects. The 2nd event of STI 2020 gathered around 12 distinguished keynote speakers, 290+ authors, 100+ senior academicians, 30+ industry practitioners from 20+ countries of the World.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">STI 2021 welcomes researchers, industry professionals and practitioners to display their scientific achievements and sustainable innovative industrial developments in the fields of computer science &amp; engineering, electrical &amp; electronic engineering, textile engineering, robotics and cyber-physical systems that are entering into Industry 4.0. STI 2021 will be held at the permanent campus of Green University of Bangladesh, Purbachal American City, Dhaka, Bangladesh during 18-19 December 2021. We are seeking original high-quality innovative research for submissions. All submissions to STI 2021 will be double blind peer reviewed. Accepted and presented papers will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore digital library. Papers presenting original research are being sought within following tracks:
