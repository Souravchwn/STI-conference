# System Testing
## User Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing that the end-user or client conducts
to verify/accept the software system before transferring the software application to the
production environment. UAT is performed after functional, installation, and device
59
testing is done in the final phase of testing. We’ve already done this test and the response is very much positive. Here are the following test results:-
So, this application was distributed with a google from among 20 people. The user has
used this app and given feedback. The test questions were as following:-
- a. The system must execute to the end of the job.
- b. The system is user-friendly and not confusing.
- c. This application runs smoothly on devices with more than 2GB RAM.
- d. The system showed all the information of STI Conference.
- e. Login and registration work very well.
- f. The system notified all the attendees about STI Conference events.
- g. An email verification mail was received.
- h. Live events were shown and attendees can join on the link with a click on the
buttons.
- i. Notices were showing smoothly.

 ## Memory Measurement Testing
 
 This test is done in the Android studio with Profiler. The Android Profiler tools
provide real-time data to help you to understand how your app uses CPU, memory,
62
network, and battery resources. The overall uses of RAM uses were so light. This
application can run on any mobile. The minimum ram needed for the application is
512M

</div>

## CPU Measurement Testing

This test is also done in the Android application with the help of Profiler. The overall
CPU use was so light. When the user clicks on the application the use of CPU rises
from 0 to 50-60%. Then the CPU uses comes to zero. When we click some buttons in
the application the uses rise to 5%.
